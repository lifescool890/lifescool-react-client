          4. Types of Information collected by the Us
        </Typography.Title>
        4.1 Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)
        <br />
        <p className="sub">
          a. PII, as used in information security and privacy laws, is
          information that can be used on its own or with other information to
          identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an
          individual in context.
          <br />
          <br />
          b. We may collect and retain certain PII including without limitation
          your name, age, gender, telephone number, mailing address, permanent
          and current residential addresses, email address, history of your
          transactions with us (if you are a subscriber), etc. These PII are
          essential for rendering our Services to you. We may also use this
          information to customize our Services based on such information as
          provided by you.
          <br />
          <br />
          c. We also collect any information exchanged by you with us in the
          form of written communication, responses to emails, feedback provided,
          participation in discussions, etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          d. You have the right to request to discontinue our use of your PII.
          To withdraw your consent to our collection and processing of your
          information in future, you may do so by sending an email to
          mail@lifescool.app or specifically informing us that you are
          withdrawing your consent towards our use of your PII.
        </p>
        4.2 Non-Personal Information (NPI)
        <p className="sub">
          a. We also collect information in a form that does not permit direct
          association with any specific individual including without limitation
          the information of the browser you use, usage details and identifying
          technologies (“NPI”). NPI includes without limitation, referring/exit
          pages, anonymous usage data, and URLs, platform types, number of
          clicks, etc. We request you to note that when you access the Platform
          or receive emails or any communication from us, we along with our
          affiliated companies and permitted agents, may use cookies and/or
          pixel tags to collect information and store your online preferences.
          <br />
          <br />
          b. If we do combine NPI with PII, then the combined information will
          be treated as PII for as long as it remains combined.
          <br />
          <br />
          c. We use various technologies and/or third-party tools to collect
          NPI, including without limitation:
          <br />
          <p className="sub">
            i. Cookies: A cookie is a piece of data that any website can send to
            your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an
            anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. To enhance
            our Services, our Platform uses cookies, sent by us or our
            third-party associates, or other technologies. You may control the
            effect of cookies through your browser settings; however, some
            features of our Services may not work properly if your use of
            cookies is disabled.
            <br />
            <br />
            ii. Web beacon or other technologies: We often use web beacon in
            conjunction with cookies, to enhance our Services on a number of
            pages of the Platform. A non-identifiable notice of a visitor's
            visit to a page on the Platform is generated and recorded. Such
            notice may be processed by us or our third-party associates. To
            disable some of these features, you may disable cookies in your web
            browser's settings. Web beacon and other technologies will still
            detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate are
            disregarded and cannot be associated with other non-identifiable
            cookie information.
            <br />
            <br />
            iii. Google Analytics or other tools: Our Platform uses certain
            third-party tools (including but not limited to Google Analytics),
            in order to evaluate your use of our Platform, and to provide other
            services relating to the Platform activity, among other things.
          </p>
          <br />
          d. We may also collect other non-specific information to provide you
          better access to our Services each time, such as preferences and
          interests and other non-personal details via the Platform, any
          application form or email or any other medium. We may also store and
          publish such information to assist us in making the Platform better
          and easier to use.
          <br />
          <br />
          e. Additionally, we may collect and use technical data and related
          information, including but not limited to technical information about
          your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is
          gathered periodically, to facilitate the provision of software updates
          and other Services to you. We may use this information, among other
          things, to improve our Services or technologies.
        </p>
        <Typography.Title level={5}>
          5. Information Usage and Sharing
        </Typography.Title>
        5.1 Our primary goal in collecting the information is for us to render
        our Services to you, and to ensure quality and efficiency in the
        Services provided to you. We may also use such information to verify
        whether you are entitled to access and use the Platform and the Services
        made available through the Platform. Additionally, we will also be using
        the information for our internal operational purposes, such as
        providing, maintaining, evaluating, and improving the Platform and our
        Services, and also for providing customer support. We would also be
        sharing the information with others in the manner provided in this

        security measures;
        <br />
        <br />
        b. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or
        disclosure of such PII is reasonably necessary to: (i) satisfy any
        applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental
        request including to law enforcement and in response to a court order,
        (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, technical or security
        issues, (iii) enforce applicable Policies of the Platform, which may be

        or the public as required or permitted by law;
        <br />
        <br />
        c. To protect ourselves against third-party claims;
        <br />
        <br />
        d. We may partner with third-party entities to provide you with
        additional services related to our business or other programs that
        involve third parties, and this impliedly authorizes us to share your
        PII with those parties. A third party's use of your information is bound
        by contracts and agreements between us and the third party. We only
        share information reasonably needed to provide the additional
        services/benefits. By sharing information with us, you agree that we are
        not liable or responsible for the actions or inactions of third parties;
        <br />
        <br />
        e. We may disclose/share information to third-parties who support our
        business, such as those providing technical infrastructure services,
        analysing how our services are used, measuring the effectiveness of
        advertisements, providing customer support and business support
        services, facilitating payments, or conducting research and surveys, and
        the information will be used for the limited purposes of such services
        received by us.
        <br />
        <br />
        f. We may also provide your information to our partners, associates,
        advertisers, service providers or other third parties to provide,
        advertise or market their legitimate products and/or services which may
        be of your interest. You will have the choice to 'opt out' of such
        marketing or promotional communications at your will.

        and services. Information collected by third parties, which may include
        without limitation information such as location data or contact details,
        is governed by the privacy practices undertaken by such third parties.

        parties. We expressly assert that we cannot be responsible for these
        practices.
        <br />
        <br />
        6.2 We may have presence on social networking websites including but not
        limited to LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and blogs
        which are promotional and business initiatives to attract, engage and
        connect to a larger group of people. The domain links contained therein

          7. Information Security & Retention
        </Typography.Title>
        7.1 We take precautions including without limitation, administrative,
        technical and physical measures to safeguard your personal information
        against loss, misuse or theft, as well as against destruction,
        alteration, disclosure and unauthorized access.
        <br />
        <br />
        7.2 For this purpose, we adopt internal reviews of the data collection,
        storage and processing practices and security measures, including
        appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
        unauthorized access to systems, where we store your PII. Specifically,
        while we will ensure our best efforts to protect your information in
        line with commercially reasonable efforts and general industry
        standards; however, we do not represent, warrant, or guarantee that your
        information will be protected against unauthorized access, loss, misuse,
        or alterations beyond our reasonable control.
        <br />
        <br />
        7.3 When you use our Services or post on the Platform, some of the PII
        you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used
        by them. You are responsible for such PII you choose to submit in these
        instances. For example, if you list your name and email address on the
        Platform while providing comments or reviews, that information may be
        public. Further, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
        of your account and password and for restricting access to your
        computer/mobile systems, and you agree to accept responsibility for all
        activities that occur under your account or password.
        <br />
        <br />
        7.4 We may share your information with third parties for the purposes
        mentioned in Clause 5 under confidentiality arrangements in connection
        with our Services, which inter alia provides that such third parties may
        not further disclose the information.
        <br />
        <br />
        7.5 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Privacy Policy or
        elsewhere, we shall not be held responsible for any loss, damage or
        misuse of your PII, if such loss, damage or misuse is attributable to a
        Force Majeure Event (defined below):
        <br />
        <br />
        7.6 A "Force Majeure Event" shall mean any event that is beyond our
        reasonable control and shall include, without limitation, sabotage,

        security and encryption (provided it is beyond our reasonable commercial
        control), power or electricity failure or unavailability of adequate
        power or electricity. While we will endeavour to take all reasonable and
        appropriate steps to keep secure any PII which we hold about you and
        prevent unauthorized access, you acknowledge that the internet or
        computer networks are not fully secure and that we cannot provide any
        absolute assurance regarding the security of your PII. Please exercise
        reasonable caution when determining what information you disclose via
        the Platform.
        <br />
        <br />
        7.7 You understand and agree that the we may continue to store your
        information after you cease to use the Services or disable your use of,
        or access to the Services or the Platform. Please note that we shall not
        use, share and/or disclose your PII with third parties, after you cease
        to use our Services or disable your use of, or access to the Services or
        the Platform, unless required by law to do so. NPI will be retained
        indefinitely, and we may continue to use, share and/or disclose your NPI
        in furtherance of our Policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        7.8 You acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right to remove or
        edit content, refuse Services, terminate accounts, or cancel plans at
        our sole discretion.

        have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these
        outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of

          9. Payment Related Details
        </Typography.Title>
        9.1 We use secure networks for processing online payments for
        subscriptions. We do not store your credit card/debit card details or
        your internet banking details on our servers. The payment data is
        encrypted through the 3rd party payment gateway when processing your
        payments. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is
        necessary to complete your purchase transaction and is not saved
        thereafter.
        <br />
        <br />
        9.2 The payment gateway adopted by us adheres to the standards set by
        PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a
        joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.
        PCI-DSS requirements will help ensure the secure handling of payment
        data information by the Platform.
        <br />
        <br />
        9.3 Payment gateways and other payment transaction processors will have
        their own privacy policies with respect to the information you are
        required to provide to them and we are required to provide to them for
        your payment-related transactions, and as such, those details will be
        governed by their privacy policies.

          10. Operating System Permissions
        </Typography.Title>
        10.1 Mobile platforms (Android and iOS) have defined certain types of
        device data that apps cannot access without your consent. These
        platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent.
        Upon becoming operational, the iOS platform will alert you the first
        time our App wants permission to access certain types of data and will
        let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will
        notify you of the permissions that our App seeks before you first use
